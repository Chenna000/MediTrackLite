# MediTrackLite

MediTrack is a full-stack medical appointment management application designed to simplify the process of scheduling and managing doctor appointments. Built using **Spring Boot (backend)** and **React (frontend)**, the system supports role-based access for **Patients** and **Doctors**,  and appointment printing.

This project was built using **React (Vite)** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. 

##  Tech Stack

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Role-based redirection
- JavaScript
- VS Code as IDE

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- Spring Security for authentication and role-based access
- Spring Data JPA for database access
- BCrypt for password hashing
- Validation using annotations
- REST APIs
- Eclipse IDE

### Database
- MYSQL

## üîë Features

### üë§ Authentication
- Secure login/logout with session-based access
- Role-based dashboards for `PATIENT` and `DOCTOR`
- Change password and profile view functionality
- Password strength constraints & session protection

### ü©∫ Patient Module
- Book appointments by selecting specialization, doctor, date, and slot
- Add phone number and problem description (max 200 chars)
- View booked appointments in reverse chronological order
- Print appointment confirmation
- See prescription after appointment is completed

### üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Module
- View appointments split into **Pending** and **Accepted**
- Accept or Reject pending appointments
- Print accepted appointment details
- Add prescriptions after appointment is in progress
- Mark appointment status: `IN_PROGRESS` ‚Üí `COMPLETED`

### üíä Prescription Management
- Add multiple medicines per appointment
- Each medicine has:
  - Name
  - Dosage instructions
  - Frequency
- Prescriptions are linked to completed appointments
- Patients can view and print them

### üïêSmart Schedulers
- Auto-rejects pending appointments after:
  - 30 minutes (if appointment is scheduled soon)
  - 12 hours (for general cleanup)
- Auto-update ACCEPTED appointments to IN_PROGRESS when slot time starts

### üîí Security Highlights
- Passwords stored with BCrypt hashing
- Session-aware protected endpoints
- Prevents unauthorized access via role-based filters
